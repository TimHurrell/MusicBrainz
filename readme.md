#Ten most recent releases (excluding re-releases)

request.py prompts user for artist name  
and prints out the latest 10 official album releases  

To run you need to have pip installed the request package  

then run "py request.py"  

##Please note
   i) There are exceptions that are currently passed without investigation  
   ii) I think the number of records that can be requested are limited and the records sent are not always the same for a given artist hence the   releases that print out may vary.  
   iii) Rereleases (defined as an album with the same name but with a later release date)
